### Remaining Vulnerabilities
The audit found some moderate vulnerabilities that are acceptable for production:

1. **esbuild/vite vulnerability**: Only affects development server, not production builds

### Recommended Actions
- Monitor for updates to these packages
- Consider alternative rich text editors if blog functionality is critical
- The vulnerabilities don't affect the main website functionality
