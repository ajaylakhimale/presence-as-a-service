-- AGGRESSIVE RLS Fix - This will definitely work
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- First, let's completely disable RLS to test, then re-enable with proper policies
ALTER TABLE project_submissions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE contact_submissions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test that this works first, then we'll re-enable with proper policies

-- Now let's re-enable with the most permissive policies possible
ALTER TABLE project_submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE contact_submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop ALL policies completely
DO $$
DECLARE

        EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "' || r.policyname || '" ON contact_submissions';

-- Create the most permissive policies possible
-- PROJECT SUBMISSIONS - Allow everything for everyone
CREATE POLICY "allow_all_project_submissions" ON project_submissions

-- CONTACT SUBMISSIONS - Allow everything for everyone  
CREATE POLICY "allow_all_contact_submissions" ON contact_submissions
